# Assignment 3 - Photo App

## Design & Purpose
This is a cat adoption photo gallery app. Users can come and see a list of cats available for adoption with their names. If they see a cat they like, they can click and expand the preview card in the gallery to see a cute description of the cat. This app is to help potential cat owners understand the choices of cats for adoption and understand their personality more before going to adopt them.


## Usage
The navigation bar at the bottom shows two usable tabs. The 'Gallery' tab consists of a list of photos of cats with their names. Clicking on any given cat card in the photo gallery expands the image into another individual view with the same cat image, same cat name, and a new cute description to show more of the cat's personality. The other tab, labled 'Profile', allows users to input their name, email, and specific notification preferences. The notification preferences consist of a switch to turn on and off the overall notification sending ability, while the next section consists of radio buttons to choose the preference of when a user would like to recieve these notifications.
